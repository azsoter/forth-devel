List of files:

forth_features.h				-- DO edit this to fit your target system.
forth.h						-- The main Forth include file -- probably there is no need to edit.
forth_internal.h				-- Some stuff that is only interesting to the .c files here (not the rest of your app).
gen_dict.c					-- The program that generates the C source code for the Forth dictionary.
forth.c						-- The Forth execution engine.
forth_config.h					-- Configuration for the Forth system (you probably should only edit forth_features.h not this file).

The next two files are endianness dependent, I have only generated the little endian ones, since I have no big endian target at the moment to test on.
It should be reasonably triveial to add functionality to gen_dict.c that packages strings in a big endian manner.

forth_dict.c					-- The Dictionary C sources, do *NOT* edit, it is generated by gen_dict.c and it will probably break if you touch it.
forth_dict.h					-- The Dictonary header, same caveats as for forth_dict.c.

forth_file_access_stdio.c			-- Implementation for the File Access wordset using C's stdio - might not be appropriate on an embedded system.
forth_memory_malloc.c				-- Implementation of the memory wordet using malloc() and free(), etc. Might not be appropriate on an embedded system.
forth_posix.c					-- Implementation of some words such as MS and TIME&DATE using POSIX (not stdc) functions -- system dependent.
main_test_curses.c				-- Test program that uses ncurses to talk to a terminal.
main_test_stdio.c				-- Test program that uses stdin/stdout to talk to the user -- limited, but should run if there is stdio.


This is a 32bit Forth, so you CANNOT run it on a native 64bit system.
If, e.g. you are doing development on 64bit Linux, and you want to compile on your host for testing you will need to make sure
that you have some 32bit compatibility packages installed.

Probably run these (do check if they are appropriate on your system):

sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib


Curses -- What an appropriate name!
You do need to make sure that the ncurses development libraries are installed (and eg. on 64bit linux you do need the 32bit devel version of ncurses).

Other than that it should work.
